###### planning for a Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA)

The narrative will have to use a tree node system to control story flow

I decided JSON will be a better approach for stat tracking, so no graphs needed.

This is a big undertaking, but I want to give myself experience with a larger code base

and a more complex task.

I've worked with graphs before, but have little experience with trees, the challenge will be good. 

I'll need a story outline at least before I can start structuring the tree. 

The combat system can be built without the story as long as I know what kind of characters/enemies the 

game will feature.
