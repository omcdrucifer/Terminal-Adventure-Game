I need to debug game loop, all debug on test and combat are fine
Tried to run the game as is without tests, game failed when I tried to
navigate to town first, then there were problems during combat

Being as I have debugged combat and test, it has to be logic related to those
functions elsewhere, likely in game_loop.py
