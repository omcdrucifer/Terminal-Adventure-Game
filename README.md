THIS IS A PERSONAL PORTFOLIO PROJECT

CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE TEXT BASED GAME

My goal is to try and apply what I've learned in Python and challenge myself to go further
by building a choose your own adventure game using a combination of a tree system to control
narrative flow and a graph system to manage combat. 

I'd like to try and implement some form of RNG if possible as well. We shall see how far I get
and how long it takes to achieve it. 

For now, until I have something more substantial to show, the repo will be kept private.
