THIS IS A PERSONAL PORTFOLIO PROJECT

CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE TEXT BASED GAME

This CYOA is written entirely in Python
and is meant to play like an old school
text based RPG.

I'm currently refactoring the code. I got a little
too ambitious the first time around and the code 
was far too complex for a text based game. I'm triming
down the logic and simplifying the code to make it
more appropriate for the type of game it will run.

Some of the files from the first version of the game are
gone from the test branch. Things that were fast and easy
to rewrite and test have been eliminated.

The narrative elements are still placeholders at this point.
I'm focusing on getting the code refactored and working first.
The original code was a mess and the debug process hit a loop that
I wasn't going to be able to resolve and frankly wasn't worth it
considering the code was already overly complicated to begin with.

It was just easier to start over and rewrite it concisely.
