THIS IS A PERSONAL PORTFOLIO PROJECT

CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE TEXT BASED GAME

The code has been completely refactored up to this point. The game is still moving along
but I did get set back about a week or so productivity wise with the refactor. 
Previous code was too buggy and too complicated for what it was intended to accomplish.

This time around I am making sure to do a series of small tests along the way as I
write/implement things instead of trying to work it all out with a massive test
file like I had previously. Sometimes you gotta fall down and get back up again.

The code is in some ways more simplified than previously, which also means more 
verbosity is required to get to where we need to be. But this is my first time
developing a program of this size and complexity and I am only like 3 months into
Python. So I am learning a lot and I am happy with the progress I have made so far.
