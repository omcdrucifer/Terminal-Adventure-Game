THIS IS A PERSONAL PORTFOLIO PROJECT

CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE TEXT BASED GAME

My goal is to try and apply what I've learned in Python and challenge myself to go further
by building a choose your own adventure game using a combination of a tree system to control
narrative flow and a graph system to manage combat. 

I'd like to try and implement some form of RNG if possible as well. We shall see how far I get
and how long it takes to achieve it. 

For now, until I have something more substantial to show, the repo will be kept private.

Still trying to nail down methods. Currently experimenting with JSON and trees for the player, enemy and combat values. Story is 100% going to be a tree

I decided a graph would be unneccesary for this project. 

I ultimately settled on a class structure with methods to handle leveling classes. It was ultimately much simpler than trying to approach it with JSON, graph, or tree.
